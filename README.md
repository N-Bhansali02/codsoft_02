Task 2 : Student Grade Calculator - This program is designed to calculate total marks, average percentage, and determine grades based on the percentage achieved in various subjects. This program is useful for students to quickly compute their total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grades based on their performance in multiple subjects. It helps in understanding their overall academic performance and provides an overview of their grades across subjects.

Here's how it works:

Input Marks: The user enters the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.

Total Marks Calculation: The program sums up the marks obtained in all subjects to calculate the total marks.

Average Percentage Calculation: The total marks are divided by the total number of subjects to obtain the average percentage.

Grade Assignment: Grades are assigned based on the average percentage achieved. For instance, different percentage ranges can be associated with specific grade categories (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).

Display Results: The program shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
